# An Introduction to Pathfinding in C#

This repository features useful applications of pathfinding algorithms and serves as introduction to pathfinding and graph theory in general.

The following algorithms have been implemented in this tutorial:
1. Breadth-First Search
1. Depth-First Search
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm (uniform-cost search)
1. Greedy best-first Search
1. A*

A min-heap priority queue is used for storing all weighted paths.

The following demo applications are provided
1. Stack vs Queue demonstration
1. Graph construction, unweighted pathfinding, and backtracking
1. Weighted Graph construction and finding the minimum path with Dijkstra's algorithm
1. Mazes and pathfinding - DFS vs. Dijkstra vs. A*
1. Implementation of the 8-puzzle and solving using A* or greedy best-first.
